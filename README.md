# sql-challenge

Using data from the csv files for different categories, I was able to create tables using the ERD to map it out and later exporting the syntax into PostgresSQL. 

I was able to create the code to manipulate the columns to provide the data I was requesting.

For the bonus activity, I was able to add the gitignore file to create the hidden username and password to pull my tables from PostgresSQL. From there I cleaned up the data, renamed the title_no column and merged the data sets. I then created the histograms speficically for the salaries. I then used group by the employee number to then find the average of the salaries. Ultimately showed that the majority of employees were paid within the $40,000 range. I also curiously looked up the employee number 499942 to see AprilFools!
